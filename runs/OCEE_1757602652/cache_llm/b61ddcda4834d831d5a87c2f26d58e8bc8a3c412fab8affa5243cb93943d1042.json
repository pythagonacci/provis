  "how_to_modify": "To modify the Deck model, you can add attributes to the class that represent the properties of a deck, or implement methods that define behaviors related to decks. Ensure that any new attributes are reflected in the database schema if necessary.",
  "risks": "Modifying the model without updating the database schema can lead to inconsistencies. Additionally, changes to the model may affect other parts of the application that rely on this model.",
  "blurb": "The Deck model is like a blueprint for creating and managing card decks in our application. It helps us keep track of all the decks we have and their properties.",
  "dev_summary": "Defines a SQLAlchemy model for card decks. Ensure database migrations are handled when modifying attributes. No functions or constants defined yet.",
  "vibecoder_summary": "Imagine the Deck model as a magical box where all your card decks live. You can add new decks, change their names, or even create new types of decks! Just remember, if you change the box, you need to make sure everything inside matches!",
  "edit_points": "Look for the class definition in the file to add new attributes or methods. Pay attention to how the model interacts with the database to ensure proper functionality."
