  "how_to_modify": "To modify this file, you can add or update ORM model definitions, configure database settings, or adjust connection parameters. Ensure that any changes align with the existing database schema.",
  "risks": "Modifying the database connection settings or ORM models can lead to data integrity issues, broken queries, or application crashes if not done carefully. Always back up the database before making changes.",
  "blurb": "Think of this file as the blueprint for your database. It tells your application how to interact with the data stored in your database, like a map guiding you through a city.",
  "dev_summary": "This module sets up SQLAlchemy for ORM usage. It defines models and manages database connections. Be cautious with schema changes and ensure compatibility with existing data.",
  "vibecoder_summary": "Imagine this file as a magical library where all your data books are kept. Each book (model) has its own story (structure) and the librarian (SQLAlchemy) knows exactly how to fetch them when you ask. Just be careful not to misplace any books or change their stories without a plan!",
  "edit_points": "Focus on adding new classes for ORM models or modifying existing ones. Pay attention to the database connection settings if changes are needed."
