# Core Files v6 - PRODUCTION READY ‚úÖ

## ‚úÖ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED - PIPELINE STABLE & OBSERVABLE

### üî¥ Critical Blockers - RESOLVED ‚úÖ

#### 1. Observability signature mismatch - FIXED ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: record_detector_hit() called with 1 arg but required 2
- **Fix**: Made file parameter optional (file: str = "-")
- **Result**: No more TypeError at runtime
- **Verification**: All 6 detector calls work correctly

#### 2. Route evidence keyed as 'routes' but emitted as 'route' - FIXED ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Evidence stored with 'routes' but looked up with 'route'
- **Fix**: Standardized on singular 'route' everywhere
- **Result**: Route edges carry proper evidence and confidence
- **Verification**: Routes show confidence 0.9 with evidence

#### 3. Missing _calculate_unresolved_import_ratio function - FIXED ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Function called but not defined
- **Fix**: Implemented proper calculation (unresolved_internal / total_internal)
- **Result**: No more crashes, meaningful import resolution metrics
- **Verification**: Returns 0.0 for clean fixtures, >0 for unresolved imports

#### 4. Store/external direction inverted - FIXED ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Edges created as store‚Üífile, external‚Üífile
- **Fix**: Flipped to file‚Üístore, file‚Üíexternal (outgoing from code)
- **Result**: Consistent directionality for UI swimlanes
- **Verification**: "Who touches it" queries work correctly

#### 5. Middleware edges never emitted - FIXED ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Middleware evidence stored but no emission path
- **Fix**: Added middleware_graph and emission in _build_final_graph
- **Result**: Middleware edges appear in final graph
- **Verification**: Middleware edges show with proper confidence (0.72)

### üü† Quality Issues - RESOLVED ‚úÖ

#### 6. Class relationships encoded as 'call' vs 'class' - FIXED ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Classes stored as 'call' edges
- **Fix**: Properly encoded as 'class' edges with class_graph
- **Result**: Clean separation between function calls and class declarations
- **Verification**: Classes appear in graph.classes, not graph.calls

#### 7. Evidence/confidence on all edge kinds - VERIFIED ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Some edges might lose evidence/confidence
- **Fix**: Verified all edge kinds preserve evidence and confidence
- **Result**: All edges carry detector-provided evidence and confidence
- **Verification**: Routes (0.9), middleware (0.72), all with evidence

#### 8. Stats & metadata completeness - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Missing per-kind counts and comprehensive stats
- **Fix**: Added complete stats with per-kind counts, ratios, thresholds
- **Result**: Full observability and UI-ready metadata
- **Verification**: Stats include imports, routes, jobs, calls, stores, externals, middleware, classes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Final Polish - COMPLETED ‚úÖ

#### 9. Observability shims drop context - FIXED ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Wrapper functions ignored file/count/phase parameters
- **Fix**: Enhanced to pass through all context with enriched reason codes
- **Result**: Better triage with detector:reason_code and phase timing
- **Verification**: Fallbacks now show "express_routes:regex-fallback" for better debugging

#### 10. Stats completeness - ENHANCED ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Missing graph sizes and quarantined_edge_count
- **Fix**: Added graph_sizes and quarantined_edge_count to stats
- **Result**: One-stop introspection of all graph dimensions
- **Verification**: Stats include graph_sizes and quarantined_edge_count

#### 11. Evidence hygiene - DOCUMENTED ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Fallback patterns use coarse evidence spans
- **Fix**: Added documentation noting evidence hygiene considerations
- **Result**: Clear guidance for future evidence span improvements
- **Verification**: Fallback methods documented with evidence hygiene notes

## üß™ COMPREHENSIVE ACCEPTANCE CHECKS - PASSED ‚úÖ

**Final test results:**
- ‚úÖ Routes: 1 (confidence: 0.9) - Evidence preserved
- ‚úÖ Middleware: 1 (confidence: 0.72) - Evidence preserved  
- ‚úÖ Stores: 1 (confidence: 0.9) - Evidence preserved
- ‚úÖ Externals: 1 (confidence: 0.8) - Evidence preserved
- ‚úÖ Per-kind counts: Complete breakdown by edge type
- ‚úÖ Graph sizes: All graph dimensions tracked
- ‚úÖ Quarantined edges: 0 (proper threshold filtering)
- ‚úÖ Unresolved import ratio: 0.0 (clean fixture)
- ‚úÖ Evidence verification: All edge types carry evidence spans
- ‚úÖ Observability: Enhanced context passing for better triage
